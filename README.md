# Airtable timeline assignment

- How long you spent on the assignment. 
4 hours

- What you like about your implementation.
That I could manage to create the dragging and dropping functionality.


- What you would change if you were going to do it again.
Improve the dragging behavior and make it more responsive.


- How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
I have worked in a streaming app that had a timeline for the live channels, I used that as a reference.


- How you would test this if you had more time.
I would create some unit tests to test the viewModel functions
Create a UI test that checks if after adding a new event, the new event is displayed in the timeline.

- Any special instructions on how to build/run your app.
To be able to drag the events, press and hold on the event and drag it vertically to the desired position.
